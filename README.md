## Beginner
We recommend one of these distros if you are new to Linux.
### Zorin OS
ZorinOS is a really great distro for beginners, and I may even go as far as to say it is the best.

Why? For one, it uses one of the best maintained desktops out there - GNOME - while not sacrificing on looks. Its GUI is easy to understand, especially if you come from Windows.

Secondly, it is debian based, which is (known to be) the most stable distro out there.

### Nobara
If you are a gamer, this distro might be perfect for you. Nobara comes with a lot of gaming utilities pre-installed, and is maintained my the one and only "Glorious Eggroll" - short GE.
You might know that name from proton-GE - its a fork of valve's software to make W*ndows games available for Linux.

But there is a downside - it is quite heavy. You should at least have 8GB of memory.

## Beginner
We recommend one of these distros if you are new to Linux.
### Zorin OS
ZorinOS is a really great distro for beginners, and I may even go as far as to say it is the best.

Why? For one, it uses one of the best maintained desktops out there - GNOME - while not sacrificing on looks. Its GUI is easy to understand, especially if you come from Windows.
